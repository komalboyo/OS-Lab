The snprintf function itself does not print anything. Instead, it formats a string and stores it in a buffer.

// Format and store the string in buffer
int len = sprintf(buffer, "Name: %s, Age: %d, Height: %.1f", name, age, height);
// Print the formatted string
printf("%s\n", buffer);\

** may take 1 parameter using standard input using read(0,,)
cc q1.c  (since we havent named the file, we call it by ./a.out)
echo <word> | ./a.out
